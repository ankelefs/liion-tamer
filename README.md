# Li-Ion Tamer 🦁


ℹ️ **Ver**sion 1 **Rev**ision 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Creator:** Anker Lefstad &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Project start:** February 6th 2023 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Project finished:** Currently ongoing


<br>


This is a DIY Lithium-Ion 18650 battery cell health status tester, charger, capacity tester and self-discharge tester - **all-in-one**. 🔋 This is designed with refurbushing old and reused Lithium-Ion 18650 battery cells in mind. The design shall be designed with several modi: charge only (CO), charge and check health (CCH), capacity test (CT) and self-discharge test (SDT). I will create a total circuit that can do all this for one battery cell at a time, and extending the capacity will yield in more of these to be made.
